Here’s what you need to do in this code challenge:

1. In the update() method, retrieve the Student entity instance that you persisted in the previous code challenge, using the find() method of the entity manager.
2. Set the name of the student to Peter.
3. Save and run the program. The name of the student should now be changed from John to Peter.
(You should get an update statement on the student table to update the name column)
4. In the attachAndDetach() method, create another new Student instance using the constructor.
5. Set the name to Mary.
6. Run the program to check if the Student named Mary is inserted into the student table.
7. You’ll not find it in the database. Can you think why?
8. Now call the merge() method of the entity manager to attach the newly created student instance to the persistence context.
9. Save the changes and run the program. You should get an insert statement in the console and in the student table, there should be a new record with the name as Mary.
10. Now call the detach() method of the entity manager to detach the same entity instance from the persistence context.
11. After calling the detach() method, set the name to a different value.
12. Save the changes and run the program. There shouldn’t be any update statement in the console and the name of the student should still be Mary.
13. In the remove() method, find and remove the student whose id is 1. There should be a delete statement in the console and the student named Peter should be deleted from the table.
