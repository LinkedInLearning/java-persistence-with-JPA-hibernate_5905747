<p>Explore the mismatch between object-oriented code and relational tables to understand the need for object-relational mapping (ORM). In this course, instructor Buddhini Samarakkody covers the basics of JPA—shorthand for the Jakarta Persistence API—and shows you how to implement it in the popular ORM framework, Hibernate. Learn how to define an entity, map fields to columns, specify primary and composite keys, utilize annotations, map different types of entity relationships, execute basic CRUD operations, and more. Along the way, Buddhini offers insights on how to work with different types of queries and use a wide variety of constructs to perform key tasks. By the end of this course, you’ll also be equipped with some of the best practices for applying the repository pattern to streamline and optimize your code.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time-all while using a tool that you'll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the "Development environment" video to learn how to get started.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
